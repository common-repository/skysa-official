Integrate with the Skysa App Bar service, which provides powerful apps including Instant Messaging, Announcements and Live Support

== Description ==

The Skysa App Bar is a web app platform which enhances any website or blog; giving you the ability to add over 50 apps like Live Support Chat, Instant Messaging and Announcements. Once setup the Skysa Bar displays on your webpage at the bottom or top (your choice) of the browser window; making it unobtrusive, while at the same time, presenting a range of applications you have added to the bar for your visitors and site members to use. This plugin allows you to integrate your Skysa App Bar (a service provided by [Skysa.com](http://www.skysa.com)) with your site without messing with any HTML or custom programming. The plugin provides you with options for when to display the bar (the option to hide for logged out users) and how to integrate your site members with it.
